CherryXSS
=========

CherryPy project for playing around with Cross Site Scripting, and bypassing common protections.

There are multiple "levels" in which users can attempt to XSS. This is no competition, and gives no financial gain.

Each level gets harder (I hope) and most of them require different methods to get javascript executing, however, there usually is more than 1 way to get XSS working.

Every level is accompanied with a tutorial.

Levels and walkthroughs are ordered as the following:

Levels: /level/[0-9]/
Walkthroughs: /level/[0-9]/walkthrough

I hope you have as much fun as I did making this.
For now, I hope for 10 levels. If anyone wants to make their own, feel free to.
Thanks!
